Core Vision: As Instacart drivers, we intend to solve the issue of efficient delivery, by
creating a system to determine the shortest path for finding items in a grocery store. This
will mean creating data structures to hold the grocery store data, implementing the
traveling salesperson algorithm, and visualize the layout of each store and the location of
each item, then visualise the shortest path from item to item. We want to provide grocery
store users the ability to compare their options for a given order on different metrics from
price to convenience.
